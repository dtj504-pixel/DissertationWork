# Abstract

ADD CITATIONS

Sustainable fisheries management requires a delicate balance of maximising long-term catch whilst keeping the risk of stock depletion below precautionary thresholds. Traditionally, Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) grid searches are used to find optimal Harvest Control Rules (HCRs). However, simulating these complex, interconnected dynamics is computationally expensive and time-consuming, particularly as management shifts from single-stock assessments to more realistic, multispecies mixed fisheries.

This project introduces a computationally efficient framework for evaluating HCRs. Initially applied to a single-stock fishery, the framework utilises Gaussian process regression to independently model both catch and risk. Then, by combining the methods of Bayesian history matching, acquisition functions and k-means clustering, we are able to systematically map the sample space. This drastically reduces the need for expensive simulation runs.

Building on this foundation, we scale up this framework to complex mixed-fisheries scenarios. Here, the objective becomes identifying the fishing mortality for each of the interacting stocks that safely maximizes total long-term catch.

This framework provides a powerful tool for marine policy by significantly reducing the computational burden of mixed-fishery MSEs. This method delivers timely, evidence-based MSEs that ensure that the stocks remain both economically viable and firmly within safe biological limits.

# Introduction

NO CURRENT APPROPRIATE ONE IN SOURCE MATERIAL

# Creating the framework in a single stock fisheries context

Limitations of Mike's paper/method: The paper does not consider fleet dynamics.

## Context

We are building on the paper \`\`Using history matching to speed up management strategy evaluation grid searches''. This paper is looking to find the Harvest Control Rule parametrised by $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ that maximises the median long-term catch whilst keeping the risk below 0.05 for a single-stock fishery. We have the objective function @eq-objectivefunctionsinglestock in the paper which combines the risk and the catch and so this is the function we want to maximise to get our maximum median catch with the constraint of keeping the risk below 0.05.

To do this, the paper takes a Bayesian History Matching (BHM) approach. Firstly, we sample our first eight points which are spaced evenly throughout the sample space to get some initial data. Then, for each round we do the following:

-   We set up or update the Gaussian Process (GP) to model $\ln(risk)$ and the GP to model $\ln(median\ catch)$

-   We can then use the risk as a threshold so that we only consider the values of $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ that have a high probability of having risk below 0.05

-   We use the GP which is modelling $\ln(median\ catch)$ to get the value for the median catch at every point in the sample space, which will have some uncertainty

-   We use BHM to remove any points that are implausible (that have a low probability of being higher than the current best median catch)

-   We select 8 plausible points to sample in the next round

Now, we will look at the mathematics behind the methods above and also at the acquisition functions of Expected Improvement, Augmented Expected Improvement and Knowledge Gradient which I added to the original code.

## General theory

### Gaussian Processes

A Gaussian Process $F$ has a mean function $\mu_0$ and a covariance function $\operatorname{cov}_0(x_i,x_j)$. We can then evaluate the covariance function $\operatorname{cov}_0(x_i,x_j)$ for every pair $x_i,x_j$ where $i,j\in\{1, ..., n\}$ to find the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{1:n}$ . Then, $F$ is a probability distribution over our objective function $f$ with the property that, for any given collection of points ${x_1,...x_n}$, the marginal probability distribution on $F(x_{1:n}) = (F(x_1),...,F(x_n))$ is given by [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]:

$$
F(x_{1:n}) \sim N(\mu_0(x_{1:n}),\Sigma_{1:n})
$$ {#eq-MultivariateNormalDist}

where

$$
\mu_0(x_{1:n}) = (\mu_0(x_1), . . ., \mu_0(x_n))
$$

We choose a covariance function such that the inputs that have nearby points that have been evaluated have a more certain output than points that are further away from the points that have been evaluated [@Originalpaper]. This is equivalent to saying that if for some $x,x',x''$ in the design space we have $\|x - x'\| < \|x -x''\|$ for some norm $\| \cdot \|$, then $\operatorname{cov}_0(x, x') > \operatorname{cov}_0(x, x'')$ [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

We use a GP to emulate the objective function because it is much cheaper to evaluate than our objective function. We can calculate $F(x)$ for any $x$ in the design space as our estimate of $f(x)$ based on our current beliefs. This is true even for the evaluated points $x_1,...,x_m$ as the emulator is fitted to these points [@Originalpaper].

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

When using GPs to emulate our objective function, we need to be able to estimate the hyperparameters of the GP using the data we gain from evaluating our points $x_1,...,x_n$ [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

We can do this as follows. Firstly, we let the vector $\eta$ represent the hyperparameters that give us $\mu_0$ and $\operatorname{cov}_0$. Then, given the observations $f(x_{1:n}) = (f(x_1),...,f(x_n))$, we calculate the likelihood of these observations under the prior given $\eta$ which is denoted as $p(f(x_{1:n})|\eta)$ and modelled by @eq-MultivariateNormalDist . Lastly, we set $\hat{\eta}$ to the value that maximizes this likelihood [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]:

$$
 \hat{\eta} = argmax_\eta p(f(x_{1:n})|\eta)
$$

### Kriging

Kriging is a Bayesian statistical method for modelling functions [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. Again, let $f$ be the objective function and we focus on the design space $X := \{x_1,...,x_k\}$. Now, if we have evaluated $n$ points such that we have $f(x_{1:n})$ and want to evaluate $x_{n+1}$ we let $k = n+1$ in @eq-MultivariateNormalDist . Then, we can compute the conditional distribution of $F(x_{n+1})$ given $f(x_{1:n})$ using Bayes' rule:

$$
F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n}) \sim N(\mu_n(x_{n+1}), \sigma^2_n(x_{n+1}))
$$ {#eq-posteriordistributiongivensamples}

where:

$$
\mu_n(x_{n+1}) = \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_{1:n})(\Sigma_{1:n})^{-1}(f(x_{1:n}) - \mu_0(x_{1:n}))  + \mu_0(x_{n+1})
$$

$$
\sigma^2_n(x_{n+1}) = \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1},x_{n+1}) - \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_{1:n})(\Sigma_{1:n})^{-1}\operatorname{cov}_0(x_{1:n},x_{n+1})
$$

where:

$$
\operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_{1:n}) = (\operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_1), ... , \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_n))
$$

This conditional distribution $F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n})$ is called the posterior probability distribution for $x_{n+1}$. We can calculate this distribution for every point in the design space $X$. This results in a new GP $F_n$ with a mean vector and covariance kernel that depend on the location of the unevaluated points, the locations of the evaluated points $x_{1:n}$, and their values $f(x_{1:n})$ [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. So, we can update our GP every round based on the new points we have evaluated.

### Bayesian History Matching

Let $x$ be a point in the sample space. We begin with some uncertainty about our objective function $f(x)$ [@Originalpaper]. However, we can make probabilistic statements such as:

\begin{equation}
    P(f(x)>a)= \int_{a}^{\infty}P(f(x))df(x)
\end{equation}

Once we evaluate another point $x'$ where $x' \neq x$, we are able to use Bayes' Theorem improve our integral to:

\begin{equation}
    P(f(x)>a|f(x'))= \int_{a}^{\infty}P(f(x)|f(x'))df(x)
\end{equation}

We now let $a=max\{f(x_1),...,f(x_n)\}$ where $n$ is the number of points we have evaluated so far. For the first round, $n=8$ but as the rounds increase we make sure to include all previous points of the objective function that have been evaluated [@Originalpaper]. We remove the point $x$ if:

$$
P(f(x)>a|f(x_{1:n})) = \int_{a}^{\infty}P(f(x)|f(x_{1:n}))df(x) <\varepsilon
$$ {#eq-removeimplausiblepoint}

for a small $\varepsilon > 0$ until no plausible points remain. Then, the optimum will be $x^*$ such that:

$$
f(x^*) = max\{f(x_{1:n})\}
$$

as our index $n$ counts the number of points we have evaluated throughout the whole simulation.

### Expected Improvement

The first type of acquisition function we will look at is Expected Improvement (EI). Suppose we have sampled the points $x_1, ... ,x_n$ and observe the values $f(x_{1:n})$. Then, if we were to return a solution at this point, bearing in mind we observe the objective function $f$ without noise and we can only return points we have already evaluated, we would return $f^*_n = max\{f(x_1),...,f(x_n)\}$ [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. Imagine we then consider evaluating another point $x_{n+1}$ to get $f(x_{n+1})$. We can then define the Expected Improvement as:

\begin{equation}
    EI_n(x_{n+1}) := E[F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n})-f^*_n]^+
\end{equation}

where $[F(x_{n+1})-f^*_n]^+$ is the positive part of $[F(x_{n+1})-f^*_n]$. This acquisition function is relatively easy to optimise and many different methods have been developed for doing this [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

There is another expression for $EI_n(x_{n+1})$:

$$
EI_n(x_{n+1}) =  [(\mu_n(x_{n+1})-f_n^*\cdot\Phi(Z))+(\sigma_n(x_{n+1})\cdot\phi(Z))]^+
$$ {#eq-EIincode}

where again the notation $[\cdot]^+$ means the positive part and where:

$$
Z = \frac{\mu_n(x_{n+1})-f_n^*}{\sigma_n(x_{n+1})}
$$

@eq-EIincode can be gained from @eq-MultivariateNormalDist by setting $k = n+1$ and then studying the distribution of $F(x_{n+1})-f^*_n$. However, we can also consider it as a version of Equation (15) from @EfficientGlobalOptimizationofExpensiveBlackBoxFunctions where we first flip the signs as we are focused on the maximisation case and then set $f_{min} = f^*_n$, $\hat{y} = \mu_n(x)$ and $s = \sigma_n(x)$.

### Augmented Expected Improvement

This was included to help make the method perform better for noisy functions which will make it more generally applicable [@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels]. To deal with these noisy observations, a change was proposed to the standard EI function as detailed below. This change seems mostly to have been justified by empirical performance [@letham2018constrainedbayesianoptimizationnoisy].

By adjusting Equation (12) found in @GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels to our own notation, we get that:

\begin{equation}
    AEI_n(x_{n+1})=E[F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n})-f^*_{eb}]^+\left(1- \frac{\sigma_{obs}}{\sqrt{\sigma_n^2(x_{n+1})+\sigma_{obs}^2}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{obs}$ is the standard deviation of the noise variable set by the user and $\sigma_n(x)$ is the standard deviation of GP $F$ at the $n^{th}$ iteration, as used beforehand. We have also changed $f^*_n$ to $f^*_{eb}$ which is the highest predicted mean at any sampled point so far so that we take into account that the uncertainty in our observations could cause a large spike [@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels].

### Knowledge Gradient

We remove the assumption of EI that we have to return a pre-evaluated point as our best point [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. This allows us to do some different computations to the ones in EI. We also now start by saying that the solution we would choose if we have to stop sampling after $n$ points would be the point in the design space with the largest $\mu_n(\cdot)$ value, where $\mu_n(\cdot)$ is the mean vector of the posterior probability distribution after $n$ iterations. We call this maximum ${x_n^*}$ and then can say that $F(x_n^*)$ is random under the posterior distribution and has the mean vector after sampling $f(x_{1:n})$ of:

$$
\mu_n^* := \mu_n(x_n^*) = max_{x}\mu_n(x)
$$

where $x$ is any point in the sample space [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

Then, we imagine that we are now allowed to sample a new point $x_{n+1}$. We get a new posterior distribution at the point $x$ which we can calculate using @eq-posteriordistributiongivensamples by replacing $x_{n+1}$ with $x$ and $x_{1:n}$ with $x_{1:n+1}$ to include our new observation. This will have the posterior mean function $\mu_{n+1}(\cdot)$ defined as:

$$
\mu_{n+1}(x) = \mu_n(x) + \frac{\operatorname{cov}_n(x_{n+1},x)}{\operatorname{var}_n(x_{n+1}) + \sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}^2}(F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n})-\mu_n(x_{n+1}))
$$ {#eq-updatemuKG}

where $\sigma_{obs}$ is a noise variable which can be determined by the user [@ungredda2022efficientcomputationknowledgegradient]. The conditional expected value for $F(x_n^*)$ changes to be:

$$
\mu_{n+1}^* := max_x\mu_{n+1}(x)
$$

So, we can see that the increase in the conditional expected value of $F(x_n^*)$ by sampling the new point $x_{n+1}$ is:

$$
\mu_{n+1}^* - \mu_n^*
$$ {#eq-increaseinconditionalexpectedvalue}

While this quantity is unknown before we sample $x_{n+1}$, we can calculate it's expected value given our observations $x_1,...,x_n$. The Knowledge Gradient (KG) for sampling at a new point $x$ in the design space is defined as [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]:

$$
KG_n(x) := E[\mu_{n+1}^* - \mu_n^*|x_{n+1} = x]
$$ {#eq-KnowledgeGradient}

The easiest way to calculate the KG is via simulation. This can be done by simulating one possible value for $f(x_{n+1})$ and then calculating @eq-increaseinconditionalexpectedvalue. We iterate this process many times so that we can find the average of $\mu_{n+1}^* - \mu_n^*$ and this allows us to estimate $KG_n(x)$ [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. This process, or calculating @eq-KnowledgeGradient directly from the properties of the normal distribution, both work well in discrete, low dimensional problems which is the situation we are in for the first half of the project [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

We would sample the point $x$ with the largest $KG_n(x)$ as our next point [@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

### Kmeans process for selecting multiple points

Combining a clustering method with an acquisition function was an idea I had early on in the project. I was then able to find literature on the subject, including using kmeans clustering.

Let us have a design space $X$ as before. We want to be able to select multiple points to sample in our next round so that we continue the pattern set up in the original paper, whilst keeping a good trade off between exploration and exploitation [@Originalpaper],[@batchspreadingoutjustification]. So, we use the k-means clustering method, which is the most commonly used due to its simplicity compared to other clustering algorithms [@kodinariya2013review].

This algorithm creates $k$ clusters (groups of points) such that the points within each cluster have the sum of squares to the centre of their cluster smaller than it would be to the centre of any other cluster [@kmeansdocumentation]. It starts by defining $k$ centroids which should be placed as much as possible far away from each other [@kodinariya2013review]. Then, we take each point in the space and associate it to the nearest centroid. We stop when every point has been assigned to a centroid [@kodinariya2013review]. At this point, we re-calculate $k$ new centroids as the centers of the clusters created by the previous step. This may result in some points changing clusters [@AKMeansClusteringAlgorithm]. We repeat this process until no points change clusters [@AKMeansClusteringAlgorithm],[@kodinariya2013review].

However, before the algorithm can start, we must specify how many clusters we want [@kodinariya2013review]. This can be difficult in many cases [@kodinariya2013review]. In our case, it is relatively simple as we know how many points we want to sample next and so we set this to be the number of clusters. Lastly, we run the algorithm on $X$ to form the clusters and then we pick the point with the highest value of the acquisition function from each cluster to sample in our next round.

## Application of theory in my project

### Set up the Gaussian Processes

We are focusing on maximising the objective function from the paper which is given below [@Originalpaper]:

$$
f(\theta) = I_{[0.95,1]}(P(B(\theta)>B_{lim})) \times C(\theta)
$$ {#eq-objectivefunctionsinglestock}

where $C(\theta)$ is median long term catch, $B(\theta)$ is long-term $SSB$ and:

$$
I_{[0.95,1]}(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if   } x\in[0.95,1] \\
0 & \text{otherwise }
\end{cases}
$$

is an indicator function.

To do this, Spence uses two GPs where the risk GP models $\ln(risk)$ and the catch GP models $\ln(median\ catch)$ [@Originalpaper]. Maintaining the notation from @Originalpaper, we use $m_1$ for the mean function of the catch GP and $m_2$ for the mean function of the risk GP [@Originalpaper]:

$$
\begin{split}
m_1 (\phi) = \beta_{1,0} + \beta_{1,1} (\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1))+\beta_{1,2}(\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1))^2 + \\
 \beta_{1,3}(\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1))^3+ \beta_{1,4}(\phi_2\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1)) + \beta_{1,5}\phi_2
\end{split}
$$ {#eq-gpmeancatch}

$$
m_2(\phi) = \beta_{2,0} + \beta_{2,1}\phi_1 + \beta_{2,2}\phi_2 + \beta_{2,3}\phi_1\phi_2
$$ {#eq-gpmeanrisk}

where all of the above $\beta_{s,t}$ for $s \in \{1,2\}$ and $t \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ are coefficients to be found through maximum likelihood estimation and:

$$
\phi_1 = \frac{F_{target}-0.1}{0.4} \quad \textrm{and} \quad \phi_2 = \frac{B_{trigger}-110000}{90000}
$$

as we have rescaled for numerical stability in the GP [@Originalpaper].

Our covariance function $c$ for both GPs is the variance $\sigma_i^2$ (which is acting as a scalar) times the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck correlation function [@Originalpaper]:

$$
r_i(\phi,\phi',\delta_i) = \operatorname{exp} \left(-\frac{|\phi_1 - \phi'_1|}{\delta_{i,1}} - \frac{|\phi_2 - \phi_2'|}{\delta_{i,2}}\right)
$$

where ${\delta_{i,1}}$ and ${\delta_{i,2}}$ are the length scales for each of the $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ terms respectively [@williams2006gaussian].

We need to sample our first round of eight points before setting up the GPs so that we have enough data to estimate all of the coefficients in our GPs [@EfficientGlobalOptimizationofExpensiveBlackBoxFunctions]. Note that until we have sampled sixteen points, we set the prior of the catch GP to be the same as the risk GP, $m_2(\phi)$, except with different coefficients [@Originalpaper]. This is because we need to estimate the coefficients for the mean function for the catch GP and the length scales for the covariance function $c$ from the same data [@EfficientGlobalOptimizationofExpensiveBlackBoxFunctions],[@Roustant2012DiceKrigingpaper]. For mathematical stability, these functions should have less than eight coefficients between them in our first round as we are only sampling eight points per round due to computational limitations encountered at the time of the Spence 2025 paper [@EfficientGlobalOptimizationofExpensiveBlackBoxFunctions],[@Originalpaper]. However, after our first round we reset the mean function for the catch GP to $m_1(\phi)$ [@Originalpaper].

We can set up Gaussian Processes (GPs) as described above in R using the DiceKriging package and use maximum likelihood estimation to get the hyperparameters of $m_1(\phi),m_2(\phi)$ and $c$ for our GPs [@DiceKrigingDocumentation],[@Roustant2012DiceKrigingpaper]. Then, we use them to predict the $\ln(median\ catch)$ and $\ln(risk)$ at every point in the design space. We can then exponentiate these results where needed. We are building our GPs with $\ln$ of the values we want because this helps us generate better predictions [@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels].

We have been able to visualise the GPs after the first round in 3D:

GET THESE IN SOMEHOW - HAVE TO UPLOAD FINAL VER AS PDF SO MAYBE NOT? COULD ADD AS A SEPARATE APPENDIX TO THIS FILE ON THE GITHUB - MAY NEED OT ADD THE FILE FOR JUST THE GRAPH TO GITHUB FIRST

The middle plane is the mean of the risk GP, whereas the bottom and top planes represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95 percent confidence interval respectively. The planes meet at the evaluated points, which are the red dots on the diagram. The scales are odd due to the re-scaling of $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ and fitting our GPs to log of the values we want throughout the code which helps to keep the GP stable [@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels].

We can then also do this for the catch GP:

GET THESE IN SOMEHOW - HAVE TO UPLOAD FINAL VER AS PDF SO MAYBE NOT? COULD ADD AS A SEPARATE APPENDIX TO THIS FILE ON THE GITHUB - MAY NEED OT ADD THE FILE FOR JUST THE GRAPH TO GITHUB FIRST

### Excluding implausible points

Recall that we have the GP for $\ln(median\ catch)$ which is modeling the $C(\theta)$ part of the objective function. As the first half of the objective function $f$ is an indicator function, we can focus on maximising $C(\theta)$ whilst meeting the threshold stated by the indicator function.

Firstly, we enforce the threshold in the indicator function by calculating $P(\ln(risk)\le\ln(0.05))$, which is equivalent to the precautionary threshold $P(risk\le0.05)$. We calculate this by making predictions for our risk at each point using our risk GP and finding the probability that these predictions for risk are below $\ln(0.05)$. This probability can be found using @eq-posteriordistributiongivensamples. Then, we exclude any points with $P(\ln(risk)\le \ln(0.05))\le\ \varepsilon = 0.0001$ by setting their value for the acquisition function equal to $0$. This means they will not be chosen as a point to sample in the next round.

To maximise $C(\theta)$, we use Bayesian history matching to speed up the process by removing any points that are implausible according to @eq-removeimplausiblepoint.

This full process ensures that only points that meet the precautionary threshold and and are plausible according @eq-removeimplausiblepoint can be selected.

### Deciding on next point to sample

We have three different acquisition functions we have investigated using here.

#### Expected Improvement

We use the @eq-EIincode expression and calculate the EI for every point in the sample space, setting those that don't meet the precautionary threshold to zero as explained above.

#### Augmented Expected Improvement

As our situation has no noise, in our code we are still using $f^*_n$ [@Originalpaper]. Thus, we use the equation:

$$
AEI_n(x_{n+1})=EI_n(x_{n+1})\left(1- \frac{\sigma_{obs}}{\sqrt{\sigma_n^2(x_{n+1})+\sigma_{obs}^2}}\right)
$$

to calculate the AEI for every point in the sample space. where we set $\sigma_{obs} = 0$. We again make sure to set any points not meeting the precautionary threshold to have $AEI = 0$.

#### Knowledge Gradient

We estimate the KG from 100 simulations and update the KG each round using @eq-updatemuKG . As in the other acquisition functions, we make sure to set the value to zero for any point in the sample space not meeting the precautionary threshold.

#### Kmeans process

We have now been able to determine which points are possible based on the probability that their median catch is higher than the current maximum median catch (using Bayesian History Matching) and the probability that their risk is less than 0.05. These points will be called the Possible Space, $PS$. We have then assigned a value to each point in $PS$ using one of the acquistion functions above. Now, we want to decide which 8 points are best to evaluate next.

We use the `kmeans` function which is part of the stats package in R to do this. This function uses the algorithm from @AKMeansClusteringAlgorithm by default and implements our kmeans algorithm described in the General Theory section [@kmeansdocumentation]. We set $k=8$ to create eight clusters so that we select eight points to sample next round.

This method allows us to search for viable points by looking in the $PS$ but also to keep the points we are going to sample spread out so that we can balance exploitation and exploration more effectively [@batchspreadingoutjustification].

### Updating our GPS

In our second round, we need to update our GPs with new data [@Originalpaper]. We do this by adding in the data for the points that have been newly evaluated this round. Hence, we can do the calculations from the Kriging section to update the GP with a new mean vector and covariance kernel for our next round. For the catch GP, we move on to using $m_1(\phi)$ from the second round onwards because by the time we create this GP we have sampled 16 points [@Originalpaper].

Now, we repeat the full process described in the Application of theory in my project section until there are no points with a $KG > 0$ . Then, the optimal point is the $x^*$ that has the highest catch out of the precautionary points. In our case, $x^*$ is the $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ that will give the highest median long-term catch whilst following the precautionary principle [@Originalpaper].

## Experimenting with the kernel and mean

Along with my project supervisor, I decided to run some experiments determining whether changing the kernel and mean used in `case_study8.R` would have an effect on the value it determined as the optimal point. This was due to the fact that the exponential kernel, also called the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck correlation function, currently being used in the code (shown in @eq-originalkernel) was not as smooth as the Gaussian kernel (general form shown in @eq-GaussianKernel). This was pointed out and questioned by my supervisor as the Gaussian kernel is more widely used [@williams2006gaussian].

$$
r_i(\phi,\phi',\delta_i) = \textrm{exp}\left(-\frac{|\phi_1-\phi_1'|}{\delta_{i,1}} - \frac{|\phi_2-\phi_2'|}{\delta_{i,2}}\right)
$$ {#eq-originalkernel}

$$
r(\phi) = \textrm{exp}\left(-\frac{r^2}{2l^2}\right)
$$ {#eq-GaussianKernel}

The mean was also identified as a possible issue. By assuming a very specific mean (shown in @eq-gpmeancatch or @eq-gpmeanrisk) for the GP we are assuming that we know a lot about the objective function $f$ [@williams2006gaussian]. Thus, it was suggested that I change the code to a zero mean which is commonly done when we do not want to make any assumptions about our objective function [@williams2006gaussian].

### Experimenting with the kernel

The assumption made by the Gaussian kernel of infinite differentiability can be too strong for real-world processes as it is very smooth [@williams2006gaussian]. The GP will create a very smooth surface due to the very smooth assumption in the Gaussian kernel [@williams2006gaussian]. If a new point we sample does not fit this assumption, then the GP is unsure how to proceed and so sets the variance very high as if it knew nothing, sometimes called a variance explosion [@williams2006gaussian]. This results in many points that had been deemed implausible returning and this is likely to continue unless different sampling points are chosen [@williams2006gaussian]. It is instead recommended that we use a kernel from the Matern class of kernels, which includes the exponential kernel [@williams2006gaussian].

My experiments appear to back up this theory. Using the exponential kernel, in our case the GP converges to a solution after seven rounds. After changing the kernel to be the Gaussian kernel or the Matern kernel with $\nu = \frac{5}{2}$ it can be seen that neither of these alternatives converge after seven rounds . In each heatmap below, we are plotting how likely the model thinks it is that this point will be a solution with higher catch, but still precautionary. Any areas with a probability less than `1e-04` of having a higher catch than the current best and being precautionary have been ruled out as implausible and are displayed as dark blue.

![Figure 1: Exponential kernel](images/case_study8_exp_kernel_7_rounds.png)

![Figure 2: Gaussian kernel](images/case_study8_gauss_kernel_7_rounds.png)

![Figure 3: Matern 5/2 kernel](images/case_study_matern5_2_kernel_7_rounds.png)

Similar results occur when we run the method once it has been augmented by an acquisition function. As we then allow the method to continue until it has converged, we find that the different kernels cause convergence in a different number of rounds. For example, `looped_ver_case_study8_mult_point_EI.R` converges after seven rounds with the exponential kernel, but after changing to the Gauss kernel it converges after twenty five rounds. When using the Matern 5/2 kernel, the GP does not converge to the correct point.

### Experimenting with the mean

Setting the mean of the GP to zero as in is more often done in examples to showcase the key concepts than when implementing these methods in real-world situations [@williams2006gaussian]. My experiments seem to back up this theory as they again show results that are the same or worse than our original approach.

We can see from the heatmaps below that the simulations with means changed to zero either converge at the same round or later on than when we use the original mean specified in [@Originalpaper]. This is likely to be because we are able to encode information that we already know about how fisheries and stocks operate when using the original mean, which helps the GP to narrow down to the optimal point in less rounds [@Originalpaper], [@williams2006gaussian].

## Determining the best acquisition function

### Timing test

The results from this test vary, but only by a few milliseconds. This is likely due to using a different runner (where the code is running) each time on Github as there can be background processes, etc. It could also be due to slightly different loading times for the R packages each time. Any random sampling has been fixed by setting a seed.

On average, after five runs the EI method is the quickest to run but is close to `case_study8.R` and the AEI method. However, the KG method takes much longer to run. We need to bear in mind that these are all with the pre-evaluated objective function. This means we do not have to evaluate the objective function, we only have to look up the pre-evaluated value, which vastly reduces the running time.

### Total evaluations test

These results do not vary, and we get the output of `case_study8` taking 54 evaluations, the AEI and EI methods both taking 56 evaluations and the KG method taking 50 evaluations. This clearly shows that the KG acquisition function requires the least amount of evaluations of the objective function. When we do not have pre-evaluated points, this will make it the least expensive to run.

### Number of Rounds test

The results from this test don’t change. As we evaluated the objective function in parallel and picked eight points each round, this means they were all the same in terms of number of rounds.

### Convergence Test

The results show that all the files converge to the correct answer in all one hundred runs. There may be slight GP fit variation which could lead to slightly different EI, AEI or KG ordering and so slightly different selected next points. However, after 100 runs we can be relatively confident that this does not lead to the process converging to the wrong point.

### Which acquisition function do we recommend using in this case?

Despite currently taking more time on average than the other methods, the KG acquisition function method will be the best to use here because it requires less evaluations and so is less expensive to run. However, it does have the same number of rounds as the others, which is important because we evaluate the new points each round in parallel, and so it doesn’t have an overwhelming lead here. The results from the convergence test are essentially irrelevant for this comparison as all methods got the same result.

# Applying the framework to a mixed fisheries context

## Context

The aim of this half of the project is to apply the methods from the first half of the project to mixed fisheries using the MixME R package. I have used the methods from the first half of the project to write code that follows a very similar process, but where the aim is now to find the $F_{target}$ for each stock that is precautionary but maximises total catch over the years 2030 to 2039. I set this goal because MixME is designed to run projections into the future, and looking at catch in the long term will minimise the chance that a simulation where a stock fails is chosen [@MixME],[@MixMEwiki]. The 20 year projection from 2020-2039 was kept consistent with examples on the MixME documentation and follows guidelines from ICES to create long-term projections based on the biology of the stocks [@MixMEwiki],[@ICES2019WKGMSE2]. It also follows ICES guidelines to only calculate catch and risk for the last ten years for long-term projection, to allow time for a recovery period [@ICES2019WKGMSE2].

I focused on the datasets from the Fixed fishing mortality management strategy example (`mixedfishery_MixME_om`) and the Exploring simulation outputs example (`mixedfishery_MixME_input`) which are both in the MixME documentation [@MixMEwiki]. However, for the second dataset `mixedfishery_MixME_input` I was given a shortcut method by a researcher at Cefas which takes a more direct approach to the simulation. The code for these datasets is `Optimising_ftarget_in_MixME_mult_points_parallel.R` and `Two_stocks_Optimising_ftarget_in_shortcut_model.R` respectively.

Both of these datasets have two stocks (cod and haddock) and two fleets [@MixMEwiki]. I was told by the same researcher at Cefas that the stocks are North Sea cod and Celtic Sea haddock, but using citations I can only back up that they are Atlantic cod and haddock [@MixMEwiki],[@ICESCodFactsheet],[@ICESCodFactsheet]. This allows me to use the same methods as in the first half of the project by replacing $F_{target}$ with $F_{cod}$ and $B_{trigger}$ with $F_{had}$, where $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ are the fishing mortalities for cod and haddock respectively.

For this half of the project, we have switched to modelling SSB directly instead of calculating the risk. This is due to the simulation being deterministic as both datasets only have one iteration and the noise for this is pre-calculated [@MixMESupp]. These conditions simplify the simulation but unfortunately mean that we cannot use the standard ICES definition of risk to calculate $Risk = P(SSB < B_{lim})$ [@MixMESupp],[@ICES2019WKGMSE2]. Instead, we extract $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ for each sampled point from the years 2030-2039 in the simulation and then model these as a GP [@Originalpaper],[@ICES2019WKGMSE2]. This allows us to predict the distribution of $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ values at each point in the design space [@Originalpaper]. For each point, we then see how many of these predicted values fall below $B_{lim}$ to calculate $P(\textrm{min}(SSB) < B_{lim})$ at that point [@Originalpaper]. We do this for each stock. This method of calculation satisfies the ICES precautionary standard [@ICES2019WKGMSE2].

Due to the change in stocks being modelled, I have decided to keep the GP prior for catch modelled by the \~.\^2 function in R for every round of the optimisation process. Despite the more complicated prior used in later rounds in case_study8.R being designed to approximate yield curves, it may not be appropriate in a mixed fisheries context where the catch of one species is affected by the catch of another [@Originalpaper],[@MixME],[@ULRICH201238]. Leaving the GP more general avoids mis-specification, ensuring that the GP can be appropriately fitted to the points [@williams2006gaussian].

The process for the first half of the project adapted to our new situation is outlined below. We take a Bayesian History Matching (BHM) approach [@Originalpaper]. Firstly, to get some initial data, we randomly sample our first set of $n-1$ points, where $n$ is the number of cores the system we are on has [@Originalpaper]. Then, for each round we do the following:

-   We set up or update the Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ from 2030-2039 for each stock and the GP to model the total catch from 2030-2039

-   We can then use the $B_{lim}$ for each stock as a threshold so that we only consider the values of $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ that have $P(min(SSB)>B_{lim})>0.05$ for all of the last ten years of the simulation (2030-2039)

-   We use the GP which is modelling the total catch to predict the value for the total catch at every point in the sample space, which will have some uncertainty

-   We use BHM to remove any points that are implausible (that have a probability less than 0.01% of being higher than the current best total catch)

-   We use the Knowledge Gradient (KG) acquisition function to select $n-1$ plausible points to sample in the next round, as per the discussion in Deciding which acquisition function is best

-   We repeat this process until there is only one plausible point left and then we will accept this as being the $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ that maximise the catch whilst keeping the $SSB$ above $B_{lim}$.

## Calculating the risk

MixME defines risk as the proportion of iterations in each year where $SSB$ falls below $B_{lim}$ [@MixMEwiki]. However, due to only having one iteration in each of my datasets, I have experimented with using a different method to measure the risk [@MixMEwiki].

In contrast to the first half of the project, we now calculate the risk using the $SSB$. We have described it above briefly but will go into more detail here. We should quickly note before our calculations that our new sample space is a grid with all the combinations of $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ both ranging from $0$ to $0.6$ in $0.02$ increments [@Originalpaper]. This range ensures that we are able to model stock collapse for cod by modelling values above $F_{lim}$ and that we can model stock recovery for cod by including very low values [@ICES2019CodAdvice]. It also allows us to model unsafe fishing for haddock by modelling values above $F_{MSY}$ [@ICES2019HaddockAdvice]. Recalling that cod is the choke stock for both of our datasets, this sample space is appropriate [@MixMEwiki],[@MixedFisheriesStatusandManagement2023],[@ICES2019WKGMSE2].

We also have a $B_{lim}$ for each stock, taken from ICES advice [@ICES2020HaddockBlim],[@ICES2020CodBlim]. The $B_{lim}$ for cod is $107,000$ tonnes and the $B_{lim}$ for haddock is $9,227$ tonnes.

Firstly, we extract the $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ for each stock from the result of the simulation we have run using the tracking object [@MixMEwiki],[@MixME]. We then put these results into the GPs we will use to model $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ for each stock. These GPs have remained modelled in the same way as risk from the first half of the project to avoid mis-specification [@williams2006gaussian],[@DiceKrigingPaper].

They have also kept the same estimation method, nugget and kernel [@williams2006gaussian]. This is because Maximum Likelihood Estimation is one of the standard methods used in the literature for our situation [@williams2006gaussian][@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. Furthermore, the $SSB$ for each stock is not necessarily smooth. Due to our discrete time steps, overfishing or low recruitment can cause sudden drops. This means we need a kernel which can appropriately model these sudden drops seen in this real-world process. As justified in Kernel and Mean Experiments the exponential kernel is appropriate for this. Our simulation is still deterministic and we still need our matrices to be invertible and so we keep the small nugget term [@DiceKrigingDocumentation].

Next, we predict the $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ for every point in the sample space and calculate $Risk = P(min(SSB) < B_{lim})$ for each stock. This can be done using a normal distribution because our Gaussian Process is a multivariate normal distribution [@williams2006gaussian]. Explicitly, it can be found using @eq-posteriordistributiongivensamples . Then, we set the KG of any unsafe points to be zero so that they will not be chosen as points to be sampled in the future.

By ensuring that $P(\textrm{min}(SSB) < B_{lim}) < 0.05$ we ensure that $P(SSB < B_{lim})<0.05$ for every year in the long term forecast (2030-2039). This guarantees that the maximum annual risk in this period remains below the 5 percent threshold, which is exactly what is required to meet the ICES precautionary standard due to their definition of $Prob3$ in [@ICES2019WKGMSE2]. - CHECK AND ADD IN ABOUT BEING DETERMINISTIC AT LEAST. OR SAY MEETS PROB2 WHICH IS MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN PROB3

This means that this risk calculation could be used in policy documents to set official catch limits in countries that have agreed to this standard [@ICES2019WKGMSE2].

## The basics of the MixME model

### Starting $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$

We started with $F_{cod} = 0.28$ and $F_{had} = 0.353$ based upon the values given in the Fixed fishing mortality management strategy example from the MixME wiki [@MixMEwiki]. These were drawn from the North Sea Cod and Celtic Sea Haddock advice published in 2020 respectively [@ICES2021Cod028],[@ICES2020HaddockBlim].

### Creating the Operating model

We first create the operating model `mixedfishery_MixME_om` which contains the true data for the stocks and fleets in the dataset [@MixME]. We have data for North Sea Cod from 1963-2019 and for Celtic Sea Haddock from 1993-2019 [@MixMEwiki]. For the stocks, this includes the numbers, natural mortality, stock mean individual weight and proportion mature split by age and for fleets this includes landing numbers, landing mean individual weight, discard numbers, discard mean individual weight, selectivity and catchability [@MixMEwiki].

In both of our files, this is loaded with the dataset [@MixMEwiki]. This true data is generated using standard age-structured equations to model the dynamics of the fleets and the stocks [@MixMEwiki]. For every year, it has the catch (in terms of landings and discards) from each fleet and the survivors from that year [@MixMEwiki]. It also contains a stock-recruitment model and recruitment is done at the beginning of each time step [@MixMEwiki].

The steps for fully assembling the operating model for input into the MixME model are:

-   Estimate historic quota-share for the two fleets

-   Project structures 20 years into the future

-   Calculate numbers of both stocks in initial year

-   Generate an observation error model

#### Estimate historic quota-share for the two fleets

Firstly, we use `mixedfishery_MixME_om` to determine the quota share of the catch for each fleet for each year in our projection. This is done by assuming for each stock that the quota share corresponds to the proportional share of landings and is carried out by the calculateQuotashare function [@MixMEwiki].

#### Project structures 20 years into the future

To carry out our 20 year projection, we need to extend the stock and fishery structures forward from 2019 into 2039. There are three categories of parameters that are not estimated dynamically and so need to be extended [@MixMEwiki]. These are:

-   All stock parameters, landings and discards mean individual weights and landed fraction

-   Catchability and catch selection

-   Quota-share

We project the parameters in each of these categories from 2019-2039 using the average from the last three years [@MixMEwiki]. This means we fill in the actual values we will use, instead of calculating a percentage that is then used in a further calculation like in the quota share section [@MixMEwiki].

#### Calculate numbers of both stocks in initial year

To be able to do our projections of catch, we need to know the number of each stock in each age class at the beginning of the first projection year, 2020. This requires us to do a 1-year short term forecast from our starting point of 2019 using the FLasher package [@MixMEwiki]. We set an arbitrary forecast target for this forecast [@MixMEwiki]. This is because the forecast target is designed to tell the simulation what to aim for by the end of 2020, but we want the stock numbers at the beginning of 2020 and so this has no effect on the result we want [@MixMEwiki].

#### Creating the Observation Error Model

This is another important component of the MixME model [@MixMEwiki]. We create the observation error model stk_oem where we apply pre-sampled noise to the catch from each fleet (which we obtain from the `mixedfishery_MixME_om` object) [@MixMEwiki]. We generate future stock and management advice from this object [@MixMEwiki]. - CONCISE AS IS SO NOT SURE IF NEED MORE DETAIL

### Build the MixME input object

We then use the operating model in the makeMixME function to make the MixME input object, which can then be used to run the simulation. We have five arguments for this function. Two of these are where we input our Operating Model and our Observation Error model. The next two specify how many time steps (in our scenario, years) it takes for the management advice to be enacted and what type of management we are using respectively [@MixMEwiki]. The last argument decides whether or not parallel processing should be used [@MixMEwiki]. We have set it to FALSE, mostly as it's usage is not currently well described.

### Running the simulation

Before running the simulation, we update some of the management and simulation settings [@MixMEwiki]. We update the arguments for when catches occur, the age range for calculating average fishing mortality in all the places it is needed and the target fishing mortality we are using for this round of the simulation [@MixMEwiki]. - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION WHY PROVIDED ON WIKI seems they may have purposefully set things up wrong to show customisation possibilities

We then run the simulation [@MixMEwiki]. It is important to note that the $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ we choose at the start remain constant throughout the simulation [@MixMEwiki].

### Analysing results of the simulation

The tracking object records summary statistics for the modelled stock and fleet dynamics, as well as metrics describing the observed state of the system by the management procedure. As well as this, it contains the catch and the $SSB$ from each year of the simulation, which is how we have been extracting these throughout this document [@MixMEwiki].

It also contains simulation performance and diagnostics statistics, which is what we will focus on here [@MixMEwiki]. We check for management advice failure, effort optimisation failure and the message given if there was any failure [@MixMEwiki]. Effort optimisation failure can be sued to see if we are over-fishing the stocks to a point that they will go extinct [@MixMEwiki]. Other results we can see are the over-quota catches and the quota uptake [@MixMEwiki]. Lastly, we can check which stock is the choke stock [@MixMEwiki].

### HCR parameters

We add $B_{lim}$ into the HCR to help us calculate the risk later on. It is helpful for calculating risk in our current way, or the way MixME defines it. - NO INFORMATION ON WIKI SO MAYBE REMOVE? TALK TO GUSTAV

### Additions or Differences in the Shortcut Model

This is the `Two_stocks_Optimising_ftarget_in_shortcut_model.R` file. We use the same data here as in the `Optimising_ftarget_in_MixME_mult_points_parallel.R` file, except that we have now also loaded in the Operating Model and Observation Error Model with the data [@MixMewiki].

In this simulation, we have a condition meaning we return zero-catch advice if the $SSB$ is below $B_{lim}$ in the year after the advice year. We are checking the year after the advice year due to our management lag of one year. Firstly, we identify any simulation where $SSB <B_{lim}$ and re-run these simulations specifically targeting $B_{lim}$. However, if this still fails, we identify these runs in the zeroTAC variable and manually set the total annual catch (TAC) to zero. There is not very much information this procedure as the tutorial has not yet been added to the MixME wiki [@MixMEwiki].

We have a new way to create the HCR, the ICES_HCR function. We also have a new way to projects forwards into the next year to set an appropriate TAC, the forecast_fun function. We call the forecast_fun for every year of the simulation and it is similar to the short term forecast we used in the last file. There is not very much information on either of these functions as the tutorials have not yet been added to the MixME wiki [@MixMEwiki]. Lastly, we set up the forecast arguments in a similar way to before, but make sure to set them separately for each stock.

## Parallelisation

This process has been set up so that it is easy to run in parallel. We are able to load in the data we need once and then run the simulations for each point we have chosen to sample in the round in parallel. As they run, each process only gathers the values we need and removes the rest of the results of the simulation to save memory. Here, the values we need are the $min(SSB)$ for cod, the $min(SSB)$ for haddock and the total catch of cod and haddock all over the years 2030-2039.

Then, we collect these results and set up the GPs for each of them. After this, we run through the process of removing any implausible points and selecting the points to sample in the next round in a very similar way to the first half of this project [@Originalpaper]. We iterate this process until the optimal point(s) are found. - MULTIPLE JUSTIFIED WHEN ANALYSING RESULTS

The process above makes up one run of the script. To ensure that we are consistently receiving the same point(s) as our optimal point(s), we want to follow on from the original paper and run this script 1000 times [@Originalpaper]. This requires a new kind of parallelisation. We were able to accomplish this by creating an array of jobs which will run when there is free space on the Viking HPC used by the Univeristy of York [@VikingDocumentation]. This allowed us to submit one job that would run the script 1000 times, making it a lot easier to do this than having to submit 1000 separate jobs [@VikingDocumentation]. We also allowed up to 50 scripts to run at once on separate nodes, speeding up the process significantly [@VikingDocumentation].

# Further areas for Development

## Moving to a more complicated dataset

Mention the one in the MixME paper.

## Doing a proper risk calculation

I now meet precautionary, so would it be much of an improvement to use probabilities instead?
