# Brief: History matching using Gaussian process emulators for a small grid of
#        management parameters (Ftarget and Btrigger). The script:
#  - loads a precomputed data table `dat` containing target fishing mortality
#    (`Ftrgt`), biomass trigger values (`Btrigger`), median long-term catch
#    estimates (`catch_median_long`) and a risk metric (`risk1_full`).
#  - defines small helper functions to rescale/unrescale parameters to [0,1]
#    (useful for GP fitting) and a tiny tolerance check.
#  - fits Gaussian process emulators (DiceKriging `km`) to model log-catch and
#    log-risk using a small initial design and iteratively proposes new
#    evaluation points (Rounds 1..7) where the emulator predicts good trade-offs
#    between high catch and acceptable risk (<0.05). Plots are produced to
#    visualise median predictions, exceedance probabilities and candidate
#    selection.

# Context

We are building on the paper "Using history matching to speed up management strategy evaluation grid searches". This paper is looking to find the Harvest Control Rule parametrised by $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ that maximises the catch whilst keeping the risk below 0.05 for a single-stock fishery. The paper does not consider fleet dynamics. We have an objective function in the paper which combines the risk and the catch and so this is the function we want to maximise to get our maximal catch with the constraint of keeping the risk below 0.05.

To do this, the paper takes a Bayesian History Matching (BHM) approach. Firstly, we sample our first eight points which are spaced evenly throughout the sample space to get some initial data. Then, for each round we do the following:

-   We set up or update the Gaussian Process (GP) to model the risk and the GP to model the catch

-   We can then use the risk as a threshold so that we only consider the values of $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ that have risk below 0.05

-   We use the GP which is modelling the catch to get the value for the catch at every point in the sample space which will have some uncertainty

-   We use BHM to remove any points that are implausible (that have a low probability of being higher than the current best catch)

We repeat this process until there is only one plausible point left and then we will accept this as being the $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ that maximise the catch whilst keeping the risk below 0.05.

Now, we will look at the mathematics behind the methods above and also at the acquisition functions of Expected Improvement, Augmented Expected Improvement and Knowledge Gradient which I added to the original code.

## Gaussian Processes

A Gaussian Process $F$ has a mean function $\mu_0$ and a covariance function $\operatorname{cov}_0(x_i,x_j)$. We can then evaluate the covariance function $\operatorname{cov}_0(x_i,x_j)$ for every pair $x_i,x_j$ where $j,i\in\{1, ..., k\}$ to find the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{1:k}$ . Then, $F$ is a probability distribution over our objective function $f$ with the property that, for any given collection of points ${x_1,...x_m}$, the marginal probability distribution on $(F(x_1),...,F(x_m))$ is given by[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]:

\begin{equation}
    (F(x_1),...,F(x_m)) \sim N((\mu_0(x_1),...,\mu(x_m)),\Sigma_{1:k})
\end{equation}

We choose a covariance function such that inputs that have nearby points that have been evaluated have a more certain output than points that are further away from the points that have been evaluated[@Originalpaper]. This is equivalent to saying that if for some $x,x',x''$ in the design space we have $\|x - x'\| < \|x -x''\|$ for some norm $\| \cdot \|$, then $\operatorname{cov}_0(x, x') > \operatorname{cov}_0(x, x'')$[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

From the original paper, we are using the mean function $m_1$ for the catch and the mean function $m_2$ for the risk:

$$
m_1 (\phi) = \beta_{1,0} + \beta_{1,1} (\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1))+\beta_{1,2}(\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1))^2 + \beta_{1,3}(\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1))^3+ \beta_{1,4}(\phi_2\operatorname{ln}(\phi_1 + 0.1)) + \beta_{1,5}\phi_2
$$

$$
m_2(\phi) = \beta_{2,0} + \beta_{2,1}\phi_1 + \beta_{2,2}\phi_2 + \beta_{2,3}\phi_1\phi_2
$$

and our covariance function is the variance $\sigma_i^2$ (which is acting as a scalar) times the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck correlation function[@Originalpaper]:

$$
r_i(\phi,\phi',\delta_i) = \operatorname{exp} \left(-\frac{|\phi_1 - \phi'_1|}{\delta_{i,1}} - \frac{|\phi_2 - \phi_2'|}{\delta_{i,2}}\right)
$$

We can set up Gaussian Processes (GPs) in R using the DiceKriging package as below:

``` r
gp_cat <- km(~.^2,design=runs[,c("Ftarget","Btrigger")],estim.method="MLE",
             response = res_cat,nugget=1e-12*var(res_cat),covtype = "exp")

gp_risk <- km(~.^2,design=runs[,c("Ftarget","Btrigger")],estim.method="MLE",
              response = res_risk,nugget=1e-12*var(res_risk),covtype = "exp")
```

where `covtype` tells us the type of covariance function we are using and `estim.method` tells us how to estimate unknown parameters[@DiceKrigingDocumentation]. Here, `nugget` is a small value being used to ensure we have an invertible matrix and telling the GP that our objective function is deterministic because it is so small[@DiceKrigingDocumentation]. If our objective function had noise, `nugget` would instead be used to add that noise along the diagonal of the covariance matrix to encode that noise into our GP[@mackay1998introduction].

The `design` variable gives the input parameters of the evaluated points we have so far [@DiceKrigingDocumentation]. Here, `estim.method` is set to `"MLE"` which means we are using the maximum likelihood estimate to get the hyperparameters of $\mu_0$ and $\operatorname{cov}_0$ for our GPs. We can do this as follows. Firstly, we let the vector $\eta$ represent the hyperparameters that give us $\mu_0$ and $\operatorname{cov}_0$. Then, given the observations $f(x_{1:n}) = (f(x_1),...,f(x_n))$, we calculate the likelihood of these observations under the prior given $\eta$ which is denoted as $p(f(x_{1:n})|\eta)$. This likelihood can be modelled by a multivariate normal[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. Lastly, we set $\hat{\eta}$ to the value that maximizes this likelihood:

$$
 \hat{\eta} = argmax_\eta p(f(x_{1:n})|\eta)
$$We use a GP to emulate the objective function because it is much cheaper to evaluate compared to our objective function. If we let $F$ and $f$ be as in the Gaussian Processes section, then we can calculate $F(x)$ for any $x$ in the design space as our estimate of $f(x)$ based on our current beliefs. This is true even for the evaluated points $x_1,...,x_n$ as the emulator is fitted to these points[@Originalpaper].

In the code, we predict the log(catch) and log(risk) at every point in the design space using the code below:

``` r
pred_risk_g <- predict(gp_risk,newdata=gridd,type="SK")
pred_cat_g <- predict(gp_cat,newdata=gridd,type="SK")
```

and then we can find the probability that the log(risk) is $\le0.05$ by using:

``` r
prisk <- pnorm(log(0.05),pred_risk_g$mean,pred_risk_g$sd+1e-12)
```

where we include `+1e-12` in the above to prevent the variance becoming negative due to imprecision when calculating `pred_risk_g$sd`. This would encounter an error from the pnorm function which would stop the code[@DiceKrigingDocumentation].

We can then exponentiate these results where needed. We are building our GPs with log of the values we want because this helps us generate better predictions[@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels].

We have been able to visualise this process using the code below. Firstly, we can look at the GP for risk after the first round of `case_study8.R`:

```{r}
library(DiceView)
library(rgl)

Xlim <- rbind(
  apply(gp_risk@X, 2, min),
  apply(gp_risk@X, 2, max)
)


sectionview3d(
  gp_risk,
  dim = 2,
  Xlim = Xlim,
  Xlab = c("Ftarget", "Btrigger"),
  ylab = "GP mean (log-risk)",
  npoints = c(100, 100),
  col = "lightblue",
  scale = TRUE,
  col_points = "red",
  add = FALSE
)

rgl::aspect3d("iso")
rgl::view3d(theta = 40, phi = 25, zoom = 0.8)

rglwidget()
```

The middle plane is the mean of the GP, whereas the bottom and top planes represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval respectively. The planes meet at the evaluated points, which are the red dots on the diagram. The scales are odd due to the re-scaling of $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ and fitting our GPs to log of the values we want throughout the code which helps to keep the GP stable[@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels].

We can then also do this for the GP for catch:

```{r}
library(DiceView)
library(rgl)

Xlim <- rbind(
  apply(gp_cat@X, 2, min),
  apply(gp_cat@X, 2, max)
)


sectionview3d(
  gp_cat,
  dim = 2,
  Xlim = Xlim,
  Xlab = c("Ftarget", "Btrigger"),
  ylab = "GP mean (log-catch)",
  npoints = c(100, 100),
  col = "lightblue",
  scale = TRUE,
  col_points = "red",
  add = FALSE
)

rgl::aspect3d("iso")
rgl::view3d(theta = 40, phi = 25, zoom = 0.8)

rglwidget()
```

We'll now explore how these GPs can be used to estimate the values of functions in the Kriging section.

## Kriging

Kriging is a Bayesian statistical method for modelling functions[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. Let $f$ be the objective function. We want to focus on the values $F(x_1),...F(x_k)$ where $X := \{x_1,...,x_k\}$ is the finite design space. We can represent these values as the vector $F(x_{1:k}) := (F(x_1),...,F(x_k))$. This vector is unknown, but we can assume it was drawn at random from a multivariate normal distribution[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

We let $\mu_0(x_{1:k})$ be the mean vector which we construct by evaluating $\mu_0$ at each point in $X$. To encode the belief that as the inputs change slightly, the function only changes slightly, we choose $\operatorname{cov}_0$ such that any points $x_i,x_j$ that are close together in $X$ have a large positive correlation[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. Then, we can model $F(x_{1:k})$ as below:

$$
F(x_{1:k}) \sim N(\mu_0(x_{1:k}), \Sigma_{1:k})
$$ {#eq-priordistribution}

where

\begin{equation}
    \mu_0(x_{1:k}) = (\mu_0(x_1), . . ., \mu_0(x_k))
\end{equation}

and $N$ is the normal distribution[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. Now, if we have evaluated $n$ points such that we have $f(x_{1:n})$ and want to evaluate $x_{n+1}$ we let $k = n+1$ in @eq-priordistribution. Then, we can compute the conditional distribution of $F(x_{n+1})$ given $f(x_{1:n})$ using Bayes' rule:

$$
F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n}) \sim N(\mu_n(x_{n+1}), \sigma^2_n(x_{n+1}))
$$ {#eq-posteriordistributiongivensamples}

where:

\begin{equation}
    \mu_n(x_{n+1}) = \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_{1:n})(\Sigma_{1:n})^{-1}(f(x_{1:n}) - \mu_0(x_{1:n}))  + \mu_0(x_{n+1})
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
    \sigma^2_n(x_{n+1}) = \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1},x_{n+1}) - \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_{1:n})(\Sigma_{1:n})^{-1}\operatorname{cov}_0(x_{1:n},x_{n+1})
\end{equation}

where:

$$
\operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_{1:n}) = (\operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_1), ... , \operatorname{cov}_0(x_{n+1}, x_n))
$$

This conditional distribution $F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n})$ is called the posterior probability distribution for $x_{n+1}$. We can calculate this distribution for every point in the design space $X$. This results in a new GP $F_n$ with a mean vector and covariance kernel that depend on the location of the unevaluated points, the locations of the evaluated points $x_{1:n}$, and their values $f(x_{1:n})$[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. So, we can update our GP every round based on the new points we have evaluated.

Our process for updating GPs can be seen in the code below:

``` r
gp_risk <- km(~.^2, design = runs[, c("Ftarget", "Btrigger")], estim.method = "MLE",
              response = res_risk, nugget = 1e-12 * var(res_risk), covtype = "exp")
```

This looks the same as before, but the `runs` variable includes all of our evaluated points and so we are adding the points that have been newly evaluated this round. Hence, we can do the calculations above to update the GP with a new mean vector and covariance kernel for our next round.

## Bayesian History Matching

Once the objective function $f$ has been evaluated at eight points for the first round, Bayesian history matching speeds up the process by removing any points that are implausible[@Originalpaper]. This is done by using Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs about the value of every unevaluated point based on the values of the points we have evaluated so far[@Originalpaper]. The general process is described below.

Let $f$ be the objective function and $x$ be a point in the sample space. We begin with some uncertainty about $f(x)$[@Originalpaper]. However, we can make probabilistic statements such as:

\begin{equation}
    P(f(x)>a)= \int_{a}^{\infty}P(f(x))df(x)
\end{equation}

Once we evaluate another point $x'$ where $x' \neq x$, we are able to improve our integral to:

\begin{equation}
    P(f(x)>a|f(x'))= \int_{a}^{\infty}P(f(x)|f(x'))df(x)
\end{equation}

We now let $a=max\{f(x_1),...,f(x_l)\}$ where $l$ is the number of points we have evaluated so far. For the first round, $l=8$ but as the rounds increase we make sure to include all previous points of the objective function that have been evaluated.[@Originalpaper] We remove the point $x$ if:

\begin{equation}
    P(f(x)>a|f(x_1),...,f(x_l)) = \int_{a}^{\infty}P(f(x)|f(x_1),...,f(x_l))df(x) <\varepsilon
\end{equation}

using $\varepsilon=0.00001$ until no plausible points remain. Then, the optimum will be $x^*$ such that: \begin{equation}
f(x^*) = max\{f(x_1),...,f(x_l)\}
\end{equation}

as our index $l$ counts the number of points we have evaluated throughout the whole simulation.

In our case, $x^*$ is the $F_{target}$ and $B_{trigger}$ that will give the highest catch whilst following the precautionary principle[@Originalpaper].

This process is written up in the code as the below:

``` r
#Finds the probability that log(risk) <= log(0.05)
prisk <- pnorm(log(0.05),pred_risk1_g$mean,pred_risk1_g$sd+1e-12)

#Finds the current maximum catch which also has risk < 0.05
#Note that we have exponentiated for this part
current_max <- max(runs$C_long[runs$risk3_long < 0.05])

#Finds the probability that the log(catch)<= log(current_max) for 
#all points in the design space
pcat <- pnorm(log(current_max), pred_cat_g$mean, pred_cat_g$sd + 1e-12)

#Check which points have P(log(catch) >= log(curent_max)) > 0.00001 
#and have P(log(risk) <= log(0.05)) > 0.00001.
#These are our plausible points that remain.
possible <- (apply(cbind((1 - pcat), prisk), 1, min) > eps)
```

## Expected Improvement

The first type of acquisition function we will look at is Expected Improvement (EI). Suppose we have sampled the points $x_1, ... ,x_n$ and observe the values $f(x_{1:n})$. Then, if we were to return a solution at this point, bearing in mind we observe the objective function $f$ without noise and we can only return points we have already evaluated, we would return $f^*_n = max\{f(x_1),...,f(x_n)\}$. Imagine we then consider evaluating another point $x_{n+1}$ to get $f(x_{n+1})$. We can then define the Expected Improvement as:

\begin{equation}
    EI_n(x_{n+1}) := E[F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n})-f^*_n]^+
\end{equation}

where $[F(x_{n+1})-f^*_n]^+$ is the positive part of $[F(x_{n+1})-f^*_n]$. This acquisition function is relatively easy to optimise and many different methods have been developed for doing this.

In our case, we want to sample multiple points at the same time, up to 8 points each round. This method of EI can be coded up as the function:

``` r
expected_improvement <- function(mu, sigma, y_best, xi = 0.05, task = "max", 
                                 pred_risk, eps = 1e-4) 
{
  #Setting up EI vector
  ei <- numeric(length(mu))
  #Determining points with P(risk<=0.05)>0.00001
  safe_points <- pred_risk >= eps

  # Only calculate EI if there are safe points and the task is a valid option
  if (any(safe_points)) {
    if (task == "min") 
        imp <- y_best - mu[safe_points] - xi
    if (task == "max") 
        imp <- mu[safe_points] - y_best - xi 
    else 
        stop('task must be "min" or "max"')
    
    Z <- imp / sigma[safe_points]
    #Only calculate EI for safe points
    ei[safe_points] <- imp * pnorm(Z) + sigma[safe_points] * dnorm(Z)
    ei[safe_points][sigma[safe_points] == 0.0] <- 0.0
  }

  return(ei)
}
```

where `mu` is the mean of the GP for log(catch) and `sigma` is the standard deviation of the GP for log(catch). Then we also have `y_best` which is the current best log(catch), `xi` which is a parameter balancing exploration and exploitation. We set `pred_risk = prisk` and `eps = 1e-4` and these are the same as before. This gives us the formula:

$$
EI_n(x_{n+1}) =  [(\mu_n(x_{n+1})-f_n^*\cdot\Phi(Z))+(\sigma_n(x_{n+1})\cdot\phi(Z))]^+
$$ {#eq-EIincode}

where again the notation $[\cdot]^+$ means the positive part and where:

$$
Z = \frac{\mu_n(x_{n+1})-f_n^*}{\sigma_n(x_{n+1})}
$$

@eq-EIincode can be gained from @eq-priordistribution by setting $k = n+1$ and then studying the distribution of $F(x_{n+1})-f^*_n$. However, we can also consider it as a version of Equation (15) from [@EfficientGlobalOptimizationofExpensiveBlackBoxFunctions] where we first flip the signs are we are focused on the maximisation case and then set $f_{min} = f^*_n$, $\hat{y} = \mu_n(x)$ and $s = \sigma_n(x)$.

## Augmented Expected Improvement

This was included to help make the method perform better for noisy functions which will make it more generally applicable[@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels]. To deal with these noisy observations, a change was proposed to standard EI function as detailed below. This change seems mostly to have been justified by empirical performance[@letham2018constrainedbayesianoptimizationnoisy].

By adjusting Equation (12) found in [@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels] to our own notation, we get that:

\begin{equation}
    AEI_n(x_{n+1})=E_n[F(x_{n+1})|f(x_{1:n})-f^*_{eb}]^+\left(1- \frac{\sigma_{obs}}{\sqrt{\sigma_n^2(x_{n+1})+\sigma_{obs}^2}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{obs}$ is the standard deviation of the noise variable set by the user and $\sigma_n(x)$ is the standard deviation of GP $F$ at the $n^{th}$ iteration, as used beforehand. We have also changed $f^*_n$ to $f^*_{eb}$ which is the highest predicted mean at any sampled point so far so that we take into account that the uncertainty in our observations could cause a large spike[@GlobalOptimizationofStochasticBlackBoxSystemsviaSequentialKrigingMetaModels].

As our situation has no noise, in our code we are still using $f^*_n$[@Originalpaper]. Thus, we code up the equation:

\begin{equation}
    AEI_n(x_{n+1})=EI_n(x_{n+1})\left(1- \frac{\sigma_{obs}}{\sqrt{\sigma_n^2(x_{n+1})+\sigma_{obs}^2}}\right)
\end{equation}

in the code below:

``` r
augmented_expected_improvement <- function(mu, sigma, y_best, xi = 0.05, 
                                           task = "max", pred_risk, eps = 1e-4,
                                           noise_var = 0) 
{
  ei <- numeric(length(mu))
  safe_points <- pred_risk >= eps

  # Only calculate AEI for safe points
  if (any(safe_points))
        if (task == "min") 
            imp <- y_best - mu[safe_points] - xi
        if (task == "max") 
            imp <- mu[safe_points] - y_best - xi 
        else 
            stop('task must be "min" or "max"')

        Z <- imp / sigma[safe_points]
        ei[safe_points] <- imp * pnorm(Z) + sigma[safe_points] * dnorm(Z)
        ei[safe_points][sigma[safe_points] == 0.0] <- 0.0
  
        # Augmentation factor to handle noise
        # When noise_var = 0 it reduces to standard EI
        augmentation_factor <- 1 - sqrt(noise_var / (noise_var + sigma^2))
        aei <- ei * augmentation_factor
  
  # Giving points with prob(risk <= 0.05) < 0.0001 an expected 
  # improvement of zero so we avoid them
  aei <- ifelse(pred_risk < eps, 0, aei)
  
  return(aei)
}
```

where `noise_var` corresponds to $\sigma_{obs}^2$ and `sigma` corresponds to $\sigma_n(\cdot)$.

## Knowledge Gradient

We remove the assumption of EI that we have to return a pre-evaluated point as our best point[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. This allows us to do some different computations to the ones in EI. We also now start by saying that the solution we would choose if we have to stop sampling after n points would be the point in the design space with the largest $\mu_n(\cdot)$ value, where $\mu_n(\cdot)$ is the mean vector of the posterior probability distribution after $n$ iterations. We call this maximum ${x_n^*}$ and then can say that $F(x_n^*)$ is random under the posterior distribution and has the mean vector after sampling $f(x_{1:n})$ of:

\begin{equation}
    \mu_n^* := \mu_n(x_n^*) = max_{x}\mu_n(x)
\end{equation}

where $x$ is any point in the sample space[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

Then, we imagine that we are now allowed to sample a new point $x_{n+1}$. We get a new posterior distribution at the point $x$ which we can calculate using @eq-posteriordistributiongivensamples by replacing $x_{n+1}$ with $x$ and $x_{1:n}$ with $x_{1:n+1}$ to include our new observation. This will have the posterior mean function $\mu_{n+1}(\cdot)$ and the conditional expected value for $F(x_n^*)$ changes to be:

\begin{equation}
    \mu_{n+1}^* := max_x\mu_{n+1}(x)
\end{equation}

So, we can see that the increase in the conditional expected value of $F(x_n^*)$ by sampling the new point $x_{n+1}$ is[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]:

\begin{equation}
    \mu_{n+1}^* - \mu_n^*
\end{equation}

While this quantity is unknown before we sample $x_{n+1}$ we can calculate it's expected value given our observations $x_1,...,x_n$. The Knowledge Gradient for sampling at a new point $x$ in the design space is defined as[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]:

$$
KG_n(x) := E_n[\mu_{n+1}^* - \mu_n^*|x_{n+1} = x]
$$ {#eq-KnowledgeGradient}

where again $E_n$ indicates the expectation taken under the posterior distribution at the $n^{th}$ iteration. We would sample the point $x$ with the largest $KG_n(x)$ as our next point[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

We can see this definition in the code as:

``` r
kg[i] <- mean(max_after - mu_best)
```

where `max_after` is $\mu_{n+1}^*$ and `mu_best` is $\mu_n^*$.

The easiest way to calculate the KG is via simulation. This can be done by simulating one possible value for $f(x_{n+1})$. Then, we calculate $\mu_{n+1}^*$ and subtract $\mu_n^*$. We iterate this process many times so that we can find the average of $\mu_{n+1}^* - \mu_n^*$ and this allows us to estimate $KG_n(x)$[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial]. This process, or calculating @eq-KnowledgeGradient directly from the properties of the normal distribution, both work well in discrete, low dimensional problems which is the situation we are in for the first half of the project[@BayesianOptimisationTutorial].

Alternatively, we can calculate $\mu_{n+1}$ using the formula below[@ungredda2022efficientcomputationknowledgegradient]:

$$
\mu_{n+1}(x) = \mu_n(x) + \frac{\operatorname{cov}_n(x_{n+1},x)}{\operatorname{var}_n(x_{n+1}) + \sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}^2}(F(x_{n+1})-\mu_n(x_{n+1}))
$$ {#eq-updatemuKG}

where $\sigma_{obs}$ is a noise variable which can be determined by the user[@ungredda2022efficientcomputationknowledgegradient]. From the GP for catch, we get $\operatorname{cov}_n(x_{n+1},x)$ and the standard deviation $\sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}^2$.

@eq-updatemuKG is mirrored in the code as:

``` r
# nsim number of simulated observations from a normal
y_sim <- rnorm(nsim, mu_i, sigma_i)
# the covariance between every point in the grid and the point x_i
cov_xp_xi <- cov_grid[, i]
# denominator term in the KG update formula
denom <- var[i] + obs_noise_var
# For each simulated y, compute updated max(mu)
max_after <- numeric(nsim)

for (s in seq_len(nsim)) {
                # says what would the new maximum mu be if we observed this
                # simulated value at the point x_i   
                # Evaluates the posterior mean for every point in the 
                # space, updating other points based on closeness 
                # to the evaluated point by using the covariance matrix
                mu_new <- mu + cov_xp_xi * (y_sim[s] - mu_i) / denom
                # takes this new maximum mu into a vector for later averaging
                max_after[s] <- max(mu_new)
            }
```

where `mu_new` is $\mu_{n+1}(x)$, `cov_xp_xi` is $\operatorname{cov}_n(x_{n+1},x)$, `y_sim[s]` is a simulated value drawn from $F_{n+1}$ and `mu_i` is $\mu_n(x_{n+1})$. We can also see that `var[i]` is $\operatorname{var}_n(x_{n+1})$ and `obs_noise_var` is $\sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}^2$ which makes the denominators equivalent.

Now, we have everything needed to compute @eq-KnowledgeGradient . We can write the whole process in code as below:

``` r
knowledge_gradient_sim <- function(mu, sigma, model, obs_noise_var = 0, 
                                   nsim = 100, pred_risk, eps = 1e-4) 
{ 
    X_pred <- dat[, c("Ftrgt", "Btrigger")]
    cov_grid <- cov_exp(X_pred, X_pred, theta = model@covariance@range.val, 
                        sigma2 = model@covariance@sd2)
    m <- length(mu)
    var <- sigma^2
    # Current best mean catch
    mu_best <- max(mu)   
    kg <- numeric(m)
    
        # Loop over all candidate points
        for (i in seq_len(m)) {
            # Set KG to 0 for points where risk is too high
            if (pred_risk[i] < eps) {
                kg[i] <- 0
                next
            }

            mu_i <- mu[i]
            sigma_i <- sqrt(var[i] + obs_noise_var)
            # nsim simulated observations - using rnorm to sample from a  
            # normal distribution is ok here as we are running a GP
            # to model the catch, which is assumed to be normally         
            # distributed
            y_sim <- rnorm(nsim, mu_i, sigma_i)
            # the covariance between every point in the grid and 
            # the point x_i
            cov_xp_xi <- cov_grid[, i]
            # denominator term in the KG update formula
            denom <- var[i] + obs_noise_var
            # For each simulated y, compute updated max(mu)
            max_after <- numeric(nsim)
            for (s in seq_len(nsim)) {
                # says what would the new maximum mu be if we observed this
                # simulated value at the point x_i by implementing 
                # the standard formula for this in GP posterior updating   
                # This evaluates the posterior mean for every point in the 
                # space, updating other points based on closeness 
                # to the evaluated point by using the cov matrix
                mu_new <- mu + cov_xp_xi * (y_sim[s] - mu_i) / denom
                # takes this new maximum mu into a vector for later        
                # averaging
                max_after[s] <- max(mu_new)
            }
            # Computes expected increase in the maximum posterior mean, mu
            # higher values mean we're getting better knowledge as to where
            # and what the maximum catch could be
            kg[i] <- mean(max_after - mu_best)
        }
    # Returns the vector of knowledge gradient values for each point in 
    # the design space
    kg
}
```

All the arguments of the function are as before with a few exceptions. `obs_noise_var` is the new name for the noise variable set by the user; `theta` is the length scale of our GP determining how quickly the objective function changes as $Ftarget$ and $Btrigger$ change; and `nsim` tells the code how many times to estimate the value of $f(x_{n+1})$ using $F(x_{n+1})$ before we calculate $KG_n(x)$[@DiceKrigingDocumentation].
