# Introduction

What mathematical methods will I explain in this document that have not been explained in [Explanation of Mathematical Methods from First Half of the Project](https://github.com/dtj504-pixel/DissertationWork/blob/main/Explanation%20of%20Mathematical%20Methods%20From%20First%20Half%20of%20the%20Project.qmd)?

-   Calculating the risk

-   The basics of the MixME model - BREAK DOWN A BIT MORE LATER

# Context

The aim of this half of the project is to apply the methods from the first half of the project to mixed fisheries using the MixME R package. I have used the methods from the first half of the project to write code that follows a very similar process, but where the aim is now to find the Ftarget for each stock that is precautionary but maximises total catch over the years 2030 to 2039. I set this goal because MixME is designed to run projections into the future, and looking at catch over all years of the projection will minimise the chance that a simulation where a stock fails is chosen [@MixME],[@MixMEwiki]. The 20 year projection from 2020-2039 was kept consistent with examples on the MixME documentation and follows guidelines from ICES to create long-term projections based on the biology of the stocks [@MixMEwiki],[@ICES2019WKGMSE2]. It also follows ICES guidelines to only calculate yield and risk for the last ten years for long-term projection, to allow time for a recovery period [@ICES2019WKGMSE2].

I focused on the datasets from the Fixed fishing mortality management strategy example (`mixedfishery_MixME_om`) and the Exploring simulation outputs example (`mixedfishery_MixME_input`) which are both in the MixME documentation [@MixMEwiki]. However, for the second dataset `mixedfishery_MixME_input` I was given a shortcut method by a colleague at Cefas which takes a more direct approach to the simulation and so is deterministic. The code for these datasets is `Optimising_ftarget_in_MixME_mult_points_parallel.R` and `Two_stocks_Optimising_ftarget_in_shortcut_model.R` respectively.

Both of these datasets have two stocks (cod and haddock) and two fleets [@MixMEwiki]. I was told by a colleague at Cefas that the stocks are North Sea cod and Celtic Sea haddock, but using citations I can only back up that they are Atlantic cod and haddock [@MixMEwiki],[@ICESCodFactsheet],[@ICESCodFactsheet]. This allows me to use the same methods as in the first half of the project by replacing $F_{target}$ with $F_{cod}$ and $B_{trigger}$ with $F_{had}$, where $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ are the fishing mortalities for cod and haddock respectively.

For this half of the project, we have switched to modelling SSB directly instead of calculating the risk. This is due to the simulation being deterministic as both datasets only have one iteration and the noise for this is pre-calculated [@MixMESupp]. These conditions simplify the simulation but unfortunately mean that we cannot use the standard ICES definition of risk to calculate $Risk = P(SSB < B_{lim})$ [@MixMESupp],[@ICES2019WKGMSE2]. Instead, we extract $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ for each sampled point from the years 2030-2039 in the simulation and then model these as a GP [@Originalpaper][@ICES2019WKGMSE2]. This allows us to predict possible $\textrm{min}(SSB)$ values at each point in the design space and see how many of these predictions fall below $B_{lim}$ to calculate $P(\textrm{min}(SSB) < B_{lim})$ [@Originalpaper]. This method of calculation satisfies the ICES precautionary standard [@ICES2019WKGMSE2].

Due to the change in stocks being modelled, I have decided to keep the GP prior modelled by the `~.^2` function in R for every round of the optimisation process. Despite the more complicated prior used in later rounds in `case_study8.R` being designed to approximate yield curves, it may not be appropriate in a mixed fisheries context where the catch of one species is affected by the catch of another [@Originalpaper],[@MixME], [@Ulrich201238]. Leaving the GP more general avoids mis-specification, ensuring that the GP can be appropriately fitted to the points [@williams2006gaussian].

The process for the first half of the project adapted to our new situation is outlined again. We take a Bayesian History Matching (BHM) approach. Firstly, to get some initial data, we randomly sample our first set of $n-1$ points, where $n$ is the number of cores the system we are on has. Then, for each round we do the following:

-   We set up or update the Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the minimum SSB from 2030-2039 for each stock and the GP to model the total catch from 2030-2039

-   We can then use the Blim as a threshold so that we only consider the values of $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ that have SSB above Blim for all of the last ten years of the simulation (2030-2039)

-   We use the GP which is modelling the total catch to get the value for the total catch at every point in the sample space, which will have some uncertainty

-   We use BHM to remove any points that are implausible (that have a low probability of being higher than the current best total catch)

-   We use the Knowledge Gradient (KG) acquisition function to select $n-1$ plausible points to sample in the next round, as per the discussion in [Deciding which acquisition function is best](https://github.com/dtj504-pixel/DissertationWork/blob/main/Deciding%20which%20acquisition%20function%20is%20best.qmd)

We repeat this process until there is only one plausible point left and then we will accept this as being the $F_{cod}$ and $F_{had}$ that maximise the catch whilst keeping the $SSB$ above $B_{lim}$.

## The risk function

In contrast to the first half of the project, we now calculate the risk using the SSB. We have described it above briefly but will go into more detail here.

By ensuring that $P(\textrm{min}(SSB) < B_{lim}) < 0.05$ we ensure that $P(SSB < B_{lim})<0.05$ for every year in the simulation and so we implicitly guarantee that the maximum annual risk remains below the 5% threshold.

## Doing a proper risk calculation

We would need multiple iterations for this.
