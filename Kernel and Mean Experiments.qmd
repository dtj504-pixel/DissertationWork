# Introduction

Along with my project supervisor, I decided to run some experiments determining whether changing the kernel and mean used in the case_study8.R document would have an effect on the values it determined as the optimal point. This was due to the fact that the exponential kernel currently being used in the code (shown in @eq-originalkernel) was not as smooth as the Gaussian kernel (shown in @eq-). This was pointed out and questioned by y supervisor as in many cases similar to ours it is common to use a Gaussian kernel. - FIND CITATION(S)

$$
r_i(\phi,\phi',\delta_i) = \textrm{exp}\left(-\frac{|\phi_1-\phi_1'|}{\delta_{i,1}} - \frac{|\phi_2-\phi_2'|}{\delta_{i,2}}\right)
$$ {#eq-originalkernel}

The mean was also identified as a possible issue. By assuming a very specific mean (shown below @eq-gpmean - EXTRACT FROM MIKE'S PAPER) for the Gaussian process we are assuming that we know a lot about the objective function (which is what we are modeling with our Gaussian Process). - FIND CITATION Thus, it was suggested that I change the code to a zero mean which is commonly done when we do not want to make many assumptions about our objective function. - FIND CITATION

$$
\begin{split}
m_1(\phi) = \beta_{1,0} + \beta_{1,1}(ln(\phi_1 +0.1))+\beta_{1,2}(ln(\phi_1+0.1))^2+ \\
\beta_{1,3}(ln(\phi_1+0.1))^3+\beta_{1,4}(\phi_2ln(\phi_1+0.1))+\beta_{1,5}\phi_2
\end{split}
$$ {#eq-gpmean}

where $$\phi_1 = \frac{F_{target}-0.1}{0.4} \quad \textrm{and} \quad \phi_2 = \frac{B_{trigger}-110000}{90000}$$
