# case_study8.R
# Brief: History matching using Gaussian process emulators for a small grid of
#        management parameters (Ftarget and Btrigger). The script:
#  - loads a precomputed data table `dat` containing target fishing mortality
#    (`Ftrgt`), biomass trigger values (`Btrigger`), median long-term catch
#    estimates (`catch_median_long`) and a risk metric (`risk1_full`).
#  - defines small helper functions to rescale/unrescale parameters to [0,1]
#    (useful for GP fitting) and a tiny tolerance check.
#  - fits Gaussian process emulators (DiceKriging `km`) to model log-catch and
#    log-risk using a small initial design and iteratively proposes new
#    evaluation points (Rounds 1..7) where the emulator predicts good trade-offs
#    between high catch and acceptable risk (<0.05). Plots are produced to
#    visualise median predictions, exceedance probabilities and candidate
#    selection.
