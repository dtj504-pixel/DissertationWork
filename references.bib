abstract = { Management strategy evaluations (MSEs) are a valuable tool for assessing the performance of different management strategies under varying ecological and economic conditions. They can be used to optimise the management procedure. However, MSEs are computationally demanding, especially as the complexity of operating models increases. I propose a scheme based on history matching to speed up grid searches when looking to optimise control parameters in harvest control rules. The approach uses an emulator, a fast statistical model that mimics the MSE, to exclude points that have a high probability of not being the optimal. The emulator is updated until only one point remains. The methods are introduced and demonstrated using an MSE on North Sea cod. Typically, the method found the optimal solution with only 9\% of the grid evaluated in 12\% of the clock time. I compared history matching with alternative optimisation algorithms, including hill climbing, simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm, and found that history matching consistently outperformed the alternatives. },

abstract = "In this chapter we present Kriging— also known as a Gaussian process (GP) model— which is a mathematical interpolation method. To select the input combinations to be simulated, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS); we allow uniform and non-uniform distributions of the simulation inputs. Besides deterministic simulation we discuss random simulation, which requires adjusting the design and analysis. We discuss sensitivity analysis of simulation models, using functional analysis of variance (FANOVA)— also known as Sobol sensitivity indexes. Finally, we discuss optimization of the simulated system, including robust optimization.",
