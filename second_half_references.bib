abstract = { Management strategy evaluations (MSEs) are a valuable tool for assessing the performance of different management strategies under varying ecological and economic conditions. They can be used to optimise the management procedure. However, MSEs are computationally demanding, especially as the complexity of operating models increases. I propose a scheme based on history matching to speed up grid searches when looking to optimise control parameters in harvest control rules. The approach uses an emulator, a fast statistical model that mimics the MSE, to exclude points that have a high probability of not being the optimal. The emulator is updated until only one point remains. The methods are introduced and demonstrated using an MSE on North Sea cod. Typically, the method found the optimal solution with only 9\% of the grid evaluated in 12\% of the clock time. I compared history matching with alternative optimisation algorithms, including hill climbing, simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm, and found that history matching consistently outperformed the alternatives. },

abstract = {The inconsistency of single-species objectives in a mixed-fisheries context has repeatedly been highlighted as a key issue in the current European Common Fishery Policy, and it has long been suggested that this issue would be better addressed through fleet (group of vessels) and métier (type of activity) – based approaches. Since the late 1980s, when such approaches were first introduced, there have been substantial developments in this area of science, to the point where the concepts of fleet and métier now underpin the whole EC Data Collection Framework. However, their implementation in the management system has been slow and difficult, being hampered by a number of intrinsic issues. Mixed fisheries are an ongoing “governance headache” combining management complexity, scientific uncertainty and political sensitivity. This paper summarises the current state of play for fleet-based approaches in EU fisheries management, and highlights our views on both their potential and the challenges they face in the context of the future CFP. As a convenient layer between the current single-stock level and the level of the individual vessel, fleet/metier- approaches could potentially address a wide range of issues, especially with regards to the policy emphasis on ecosystem-based fisheries management. However, the rigid categorisation they induce may not properly address the flexibility of individual vessels, and should therefore be supplemented by more detailed considerations at the local scale.}
